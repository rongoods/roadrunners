RoadRunners: Your Path to Better Running

Welcome to RoadRunners! This app is designed for runners of all levels who want to push their limits, stay injury-free, and build a strong community. We provide the tools you need to track your miles and motivate your team.

🏃 Getting Started & Key Features

RoadRunners is built around three pillars: Community, Personalized Training, and Practical Tools.

1. The Social Hub: Community & Motivation

Running is better together! Our social features keep you connected and accountable.

Activity Feed: See your latest runs and those of your running groups in one simple, real-time feed.

Groups & Competition: Create a group for your friends, club, or team. Easily view weekly distance Leaderboards to spark some friendly competition. You can also send real-time messages and chat right within your group.

Give Kudos: Show support for your fellow runners! Hit the "Kudos" button (our version of a high-five) on any run in the feed to celebrate their effort.

2. Personalized Training & Growth

Stop guessing and start training smarter. We give you a plan that's tailored to your goals.

Structured Workout Planner: Based on your current fitness level and your primary goal (e.g., training for a 5K, a marathon, or just staying fit), the app generates a balanced weekly schedule. This plan includes:

Endurance Runs: Building your base stamina.

Speed Workouts: Getting faster and improving your running form.

Strength Sessions: Crucial lifting and bodyweight exercises to prevent common running injuries.

Your Personal Profile: This is your running résumé. Track your lifetime mileage, see your all-time personal bests (PBs), and easily update your training goals and personal information.

3. Practical Tools for Runners

We focus on the small details that make a big difference in training.

Manual Run Logging: Quickly and easily log any run with distance, duration, and date.

Shoe Mileage Tracker: Know exactly when it’s time to retire your running shoes. Log each pair, and RoadRunners tracks the mileage they accumulate. We'll give you a visual warning when you approach the standard replacement limit (defaulting to 800km) to help you stay ahead of injury!

4. Future Integrations

We are built to connect! In the future, you'll be able to link your account with popular external devices and apps like Garmin, Apple Health, Strava, Nike Run Club, and Adidas Running to automatically sync your runs.

🎨 The RoadRunners Look

Our design is clean, fast, and focused on performance data:

High Contrast: We use a deep dark background with bright white text to make all your data instantly readable, especially when you're checking your stats on the go.

RoadRunner Blue: Our signature blue color is used to highlight the most important things—like your progress, active buttons, and new achievements—so they always stand out.
